# React-Naive

React Notes:

  1. When handling default submit behavior of a button in a form its better to handle it on the form onSubmit event not the onClick 
     button event.
  2. For child-parent communication we create a call back function in the parent then pass it to the child to get access to the data of the parent.
     Eg: 
        `
          
        `
